This repository contains a collection of small example programs originally written in C++ and now converted to Python. Each program has a specific purpose, from simple algorithms to command-line utilities, and demonstrates various Python programming techniques. This project is organized to help keep the programs accessible, modular, and easy to run.

## Structure

Each program resides in its own folder within the `programs/` directory. This keeps things organized and allows for the addition of new programs without disrupting the structure.


## Running the Programs

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-examples.git
    cd python-examples
    ```

2. Run the main menu to select a program:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the terminal to execute any of the listed programs.

## Adding a New Program

To add a new program:

1. Create a new folder in the `programs/` directory with a descriptive name.
2. Add the Python file with the program’s code, making sure it has a `main()` function to allow it to be called from `main.py`.
3. Update the `programs` dictionary in `main.py` to include the new program.

## Requirements

If your programs have any dependencies, list them in `requirements.txt`. To install dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
